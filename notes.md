# Notes

## Goals

### Primary: Score high-value deals

100 = 99 + 1 (me)

p1 (me) scores: 5 5 5 5 5 ...
p2 scores: 4(vs me) 6 7 6 6 7 ...
...
pN scores 3(vs me) 5 6 6 7 8 ...

Focus on scoring deals of the most value, preventing others from obtaining high-value deals is secondary.

### Secondary: Make opponents score low-value deals

Not to focus at the moment.
